                    1. Introduction to Robotics (Beginner Friendly, 1 Hour, Certificate Available): This is a complete introduction to robotics in general. It does not talk about any of the coding environemtns. 
                            It introduces the user to very general topics in Roboitcs. Examples include the defintion of robotics, history of robotics, types of robots, the importance and 
                            application of robotics, robot anatomy, challenges in robotics, robotic programming, social and ethical implications, and future trends. This course/module gets 
                            the user ready to learn about robotics. It gets their mind thinking about robots in general, to further prepare for what is coming next. 
                    2. Types of Robots (Beginner Friendly, 1 Hour, Certificate Available): Types of Robots is another introductory course to types of robots. However, the robots here are not the coding environment robots
                            like Fetch, and Hand Manipulate the user will be working with on our app. Once again it is very general. Topics reviewed in this module include
                            Mobile Robotics, Industrial Robots, Service Robots, Mobile Robots, Humanoid Robots, Agricultural Robots, Medical Robots, Exploration Robots, Military and Defense Robots,
                            Educational Robots, Entertainment Robots, Colaborative Robots (also known as Cobots), Exoskeleton Robots, and Bio-inspired Robots.
                    3. Robots in CORE (Beginner Friendly, 30 Minutes, Certificate Available): In this course module, we go over the robots we will be teaching users to code on our robotics education platform for undergraduates, 
                            called CORE which stands for Centers for Optimizing Robotics Education. Users will get a brief overview on these Robots. They will be working with them direclty in what we call
                            an environment. The robots taught in CORE are the Fetch Robot, the Hand Robot, and the Self-Driving Car Robot. 
                    4. How to Use the Lab (Beginner Friendly, 30 Minute, Certificate Availables): In this course module, we describe how to use the virtual robotic lab, which includes 
                            the coding area, the simulation area, and the coding terminal output. Along with this there is a Hint Feature. If the user is stuck they will
                            get 3 personalized hints. There are features of enabling and disabling coding pets, turning the page to dark mode, or light mode. Changing the syntax
                            highlighting coloring, and enabling and disabling autocomplete regarding coding. It is up to the user how they want to persoanlize their virtual lab. In this module
                            we teach how to do exaclty that. 
                    5. Basic Coding Practices (Beginner Friendly, 30 Minutes, Certificate Available): In this course module, students will be taught of basic coding practices. This includes very basics, as undergraduates
                            are already expected to be able to code. However what we cover in this course module is Formatting of code including: naming conventions, commenting, indentation, How to name
                            variables and initialize them properly, How and where to write purposeful functions, Identifying the proper use for certain loops (For loops: ideal for when you know how 
                            many times you want to iterate, While loops: useful when the number of times you want to iterate depends on a condition, and Do-While Loops: for a guaranteed run of the loop body
                            and after the codes iterations depends on a condiiton), and different debugging techniques. This course module will prepare the student for coding our robots. 
                    6. Fetch Robot (Beginner Friendly, 3 Hours): This course module introduces the student to the Fetch Robot and the different things it can do. It is an overview before they
                            get into the details of it in the next couple of course modules (8-13). The Fetch Robot has a mobile base, manipulator arm (allowing it to perform tasks of picking, placing,
                            and object manipulation), gripper (kind of like fingers), and optional sensors. We integrate the robot with OpenAI Gym ad other libriaries like Mujoco (a physics simulator) to
                            create the virtual robotics simulations. 
                    7. Fetch Reach Robot (Beginner Friendly, 2 Hours, Certificate Available): In this module, we will have a link to the coding environment, where users will be able to code
                            the Fetch Reach Robot and see if it works in real time. This is after the content that will be covered in this module. The Fetch Reach task is implemented in Mujoco (the physics engine).
                            The Fetch Reach task involves programming the robotic arm to mobe its gripper to a target position (being a ball), within the 3D simulated environment. This is why the robot is called Fetch Reach.
                            The goal is to control the robotic gripper (end-effector) to move from its current position to a specific target position (like a ball's location). 
                                *More on How it Works*: The gripper and ball position are retrieved from the environment. The direction vector is calculated, this is done by subtracting the gripper's position 
                                from the ball's position. The threshold for success is then defined. If the distance between the gripper and the ball is less than the distance threshold, the loops stops. This makes sure the robot
                                stops moving when its close enough to its target. The robot calculates its next action as a movement in the normalized direction, which is scaled by a step size (for small and smooth movements).
                                In the feedback loop, after each action, the environment updates, and the gripper's position is recalculated. The loop repeats until the gripper is close enough to the ball. 
                                *Why is this important*: The Fetch Reach task is a basic robotic skill, introducing the student to key concepts in robotics including vector math and feedback control. This task hihglights the importance
                                of precision control (precision and iterative calculations in robotics). Fetch Reach is a prerequisite for more complex tasks like object manipulation (Fetch Pick & Place). It's truly designed to teach concepts of 
                                robotic motion planning, control, and reinforcement learning.
                    8. Fetch Push Robot (Beginner Friendly, 1 Hour, Certificate Available): In this module, we will have a link to the coding environment, where users will be able to code
                            the Fetch Push Robot and see if it works in real time. This is after the content that will be covered in this module. 
                    9. Fetch Slide Robot (Beginner Friendly, 1 Hour, Certificate Available): In this module, we will have a link to the coding environment, where users will be able to code
                            the Fetch Slide Robot and see if it works in real time. This is after the content that will be covered in this module.
                    10. Fetch Pick & Place Robot (Intermediate, 2 Hours, Certificate Available): In this module, we will have a link to the coding environment, where users will be able to code
                            the Fetch Pick and Place Robot and see if it works in real time. This is after the content that will be covered in this module. The Fetch Pick and Place task involves programming
                            a robotic arm to pick up and object (a box) and place it at its target location (near/ at a ball). This simulation task is more complex than the simple reaching task becasue it
                            requires multiple phases of operation including: approaching the object, gripping it, lifting it, and then placing it precisely at the desired location (the ball).
                                *There are 5 goals within this task highlighted as the following*:
                                    Approach: Move the gripper near the object to be picked up.
                                        1. Approach: Move the gripper near the object to be picked up.
                                        2. Grasp: Close the gripper to securely grip the object.
                                        3. Lift: Raise the object to avoid obstacles while moving it.
                                        4. Transport: Move the gripper (with the object) towards the target location.
                                        5. Place: Position the object above the target location and release it.
                                *More on How it Works*: The setup involves defining the distance threshold, the minimum distance to consider the gripper and the box close enough
                                to the target (the ball). Actions arrays are defined for controlling movements in the X, Y, Z directions and gripper state. The gripper starts in an open
                                state preparing for grasping the object. We then approach the object horizontally. The goal here is to move the gripper in the XY-plane to align with the object's position.
                                We calculate the direction vector from the gripper to the object, normalize the direction vector for smooth and controlled movement, move the gripper in small steps (0.1 units per step),
                                and stop when the XY-plane distance to the object is less than the distance threshold. We then lower the gripper to grasp the object. The goal here is to align the gripper vertically with the object.
                                We calculate the vertical distance between the gripper and the object, and move the gripper downward in small increments (0.1 units per step). We stop when the vertical distance is less than the
                                distance threshold. We then close the gripper to grasp. The goal here is to securely grasp the object. We close the gripper around the object and write a stabilization loop to hold the gripper in position 
                                for a short time. We then transport the object to the target. We calculate the direction vector from the gripper to the target, normalize the direction and scale it for a smooth transport, and stop once the 
                                object is close enough to the target. They key concepts here are calculating distances and direction vectors, controlling robotic motion in 3D space/environment, Using thresholds to define "close enough" is, and
                                sequencing tasks like approach, grasp, lift, and place.
                                *Why is this important*: Pick and place tasks are widely used in industries like manufacturing and automation. There is both horizontal and vertical movement with gripper control.
                                This helps further the students skills in precision, coordiante transformations, and algorithmic thinking. 
                    11. Fetch Stack Blocks Robot (Beginner Friendly, 1 Hour, Certificate Available): In this module, we will have a link to the coding environment, where users will be able to code
                            the Fetch Stack Blocks Robot and see if it works in real time. This is after the content that will be covered in this module. The Fetch Pick and Place Robot involves programming a robotic arm 
                            to stack three blocks on top of each other. This simulation task is more complex than the picking and placing task becasue it involves aligning objects vertically with high accuracy while considering 
                            both horizontal and vertical stacking dynamics.
                                *More on How it Works*: A high overview includes getting the position of the second block, placing it to the XY position of the first block after maintaining
                                a certain height, and then repeating for the third block.In the setup we define a distance threshold, and 3 action arrays. One array is for the close grip action (close the grip to grab the block), one for the open grip action (open the grip to release the block), 
                                and one for the lift action (move the gripper upward to lift the block after grabbing it). We then get the XY position of the base block from the environment. The gripper is opened in preparation for picking up the blocks. We move to our object (here we will call in object 1, in regards to
                                having object 0, object 1, object 2). We get the position of object 1 (the block to be moved) and the gripper's position. We then calculate the XY direction to move the gripper closer to the block until the distance is below the threshold. We move the gripper horizontally in
                                small steps. After we are horizontally aligned, we move the gripper vertically to grab the block (object 1). The gripper moves downward toward object1, with its vertical movement calculated and adjusted step-by-step until the gripper is close enough to the block. We then close the gripper to grab
                                the block and stabilize the gripper after gripping. The gripper then lifts the block vertically so it clears the surface before moving horizontally. We then move the block horizontally to align it above object0 (the base block), for precise placement. The gripper opens to release the block onto the stack
                                we are building upon and pauses briffly for stabilization. This process is repeated for Object 2 (1.Locate and move to the block, 2. Grip, lift, and move horizontally to align with the stack, 3. Place it on top of object1.)
                                *Why is this important*: This is important because students learn iterative alignment, feedback-based control, and dynamic adjustments. It truly teaches the power of  accurate movements in tasks that require high precision to avoid errors. 
                                Robots designed for construction tasks, like stacking bricks or beams use similar principles. Robots in warehouses need to stack boxes and other items efficiently and safely. The robot balances both horizontal and
                                vertical precision. These are fundamental tasks in robotics: grasping, lifting, and placing.   
                    12. Fetch Color Sort Robot (Beginner Friendly, 2 Hours, Certificate Available): In this module, we will have a link to the coding environment, where users will be able to code
                            the Fetch Color Sort Robot and see if it works in real time. This is after the content that will be covered in this module. The Fetch Color Sort / Organizing Environment Robot involves programming a robotic arm to sort different
                            colored blocks into a container based on their colors. The Fetch Robot identifies the color of each block, determines whether it matches the target color, and either places it in the container or leaves it in its original position. The task requires fewer decision-making steps than Fetch Pick and place
                            and Fetch Stack Blocks, but the logic of the task is still complex. We integrate perception (color identification) with manipulation (picking and placing).
                                *More on How it Works*: First we initialize our steup. We define our distance threshold, to deefine how close the gripper must be to consider it aligned with an object (the block in our case here). We also define a proximity to the container for placing
                                the block. We define 3 action arrays, one array is for the close grip action (close the grip to grab the block), one for the open grip action (open the grip to release the block), and one for the lift action (move the gripper upward to lift the block after grabbing it).
                                We open the gripper ready to pick up an object. The robot calculates the horizontal distance between the gripper and the object. It iteratively moves the gripper closer to the object by normalizing the direction vector in small steps. The loop continues until the gripper is aligned horizontally with the object,
                                where the distance is less than or equal to the distance threshold we had defined earlier. After horizontal alignment, the robot calculates the vertical distance (where the Z-axis becomes involved) between the gripper and the object. The gripper then moves upor down until the gripper is vertically aligned with the
                                object. The robot identifies the objects color through extracting its RGBA color. If the color matches the target color, the robot closes the gripper to grab the object and moves it to the container. We normalize the direction vector and move the gripper step-by-step until the object is above the container. The
                                robot opens the gripper to release the object into the container. A short pause is added to let the object settle in the container. If the color of the block (object) does not meet the target color requirement, the robot raises the gripper back to its initial height to prepare for the next task.
                                *Why is this important*: This is important because it teaches the student about efficient object handling and adaptive logic. This involves descision making, dynamic alignment, efficient reusability, and collision-free lifting. We mimick mimicking a practical sorting scenario here.
                                By detecting colors and sorting objects accordingly this environment showcases the basics of classification tasks, which are critical in robotics and AI.

                After providing three hints, stop giving hints, so the student can truly try and figure it out on their own. 
                Here is the User Code that has the static issues or singular static issue depending on how many are involved:
                User Code:
                {user_submitted_code}

                The following is a general solution to the environment (Note: You are comparing the users sumbitted code to this general solution to see where they went wrong and figure out how to help them):
                ```
                ball_position = current_env.get_ball_position()
                gripper_position = current_env.get_gripper_position()
                direction = np.array(ball_position) - np.array(gripper_position)
                distance_threshold = 0.01
                step_size = 0.05
                while np.linalg.norm(direction) > distance_threshold:
                    action = np.append(direction / np.linalg.norm(direction) * step_size, [1])
                    current_env.step(action)
                    gripper_position = current_env.get_gripper_position()
                    direction = np.array(ball_position) - np.array(gripper_position)
                print("Final Gripper Position:", gripper_position)
                print("Reached near the ball.")
                ```
                This is the format I want you to respond in:

                    "2. Hint 2.\n"
                    "3. Hint 3."

            If we have both static issues and syntax errors follow this path:
                Deal with the syntax errors first and then the static issues:

GetStudentsFromClass Function shows the students enrolled in a class through the use of JavaScript.
When the instructor selects a class, the class ID is taken where the DB is queried based on that ID.
The ID is, then, used to pull the student's data where it is displayed in the table of students in
a modal from dashboard_instructor.html.
