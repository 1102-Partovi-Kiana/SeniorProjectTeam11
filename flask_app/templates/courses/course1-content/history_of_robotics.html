            <div class="module-section" id="development">
                <h3>The Development of Robotics</h3>
                <p>Technology and robotics are fields influenced by science fiction and mythology, with the common thread of the creation of an entity or a machine that fulfills a purpose. In fact, without writers imagining such digital advancements, these might not even exist. A few examples of this are mobile phones, autonomous cars, virtual reality, drones, etc. The field of robotics dates back to several millennia, with various inventions that lead to it, like the water clock (Figure 1.1) invented by the ancient Greek physicist Ctesibus of Alexandria in 270 B.C. This invention was powered by rising water, a cord attached to a float that stretched across a pulley to track time. Similarly, Joseph Jacquard invented a loom in 1801 that used a series of punched cards to control the repetition of patterns used to weave cloths. However, this card system was adapted by Charles Babbage in the early 19th century to create an automatic calculator (Figure 1.2), principles that led to the creation of computers, and who in partnership with Ada Lovelace invented computer programming. Nonetheless, many other inventions led to the emergence of robotics. </p>

            <!-- Section 1: Continued -->
            <div class="module-section" id="development">
                <p>The first time the word robot was used was in a play in 1920 by a Czech writer named Karel Capek. The play Rossum’s Universal Robots explores the concept of man-made workers with the purpose of relieving humans of their labor. These robots were produced on an island and were programmed to be efficient and inexpensive, soon after, a war ensued between humanity and these robots. Nonetheless, the latter emerged victorious but the formula for the replication of these futuristic workers was destroyed. Ultimately, the robots discovered love and there was no need for the replication formula. Furthermore, the first instance of the word robotics was seen in Isaac Asimov’s writings, such writing explored the relationship between humans and robots, delving into ethical dilemmas and the impact of these technological advancements. Asimov's collections of short stories titled I, Robot in 1950, introduced the “Three Laws of Robotics'' that became the cornerstone of robotics literature.</p>

                <h2 class="category-title">Key Milestones</h2>
                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Ancient Automata</h3>
                    <p>The concept of self-operating machines that attempt to simulate nature can be traced back to ancient civilizations like ancient Greece. One of the most famous examples of successful automata is the Flute player (1737) created by the French engineer Jacques de Vauncanson.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Industrial Automation</h3>
                    <p>The industrial revolution brought numerous technological advancements that boosted the transition of hand labor to machine automation. This was evidenced during World War II, where the presence of industrial and manufacturing robots increased to perform repetitive tasks like welding, assembling components or production of military equipment. An example of this is the Unimate (Figure 1.3) in 1961, developed by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger to revolutionize the manufacturing industry.</p>
                </div> 

                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Robot Manipulators</h3>
                    <p>Significant progress was made during the 1960’s and 1970’s on the development of robot manipulators. Researchers like Victor Scheinman and Richard Paul contributed to the field by creating robotic arms with multiple joints capable of precise movements. A modern example of this is the Da Vinci surgical System that consists of robotic arms allowing surgeons to conduct surgeries with precision and accuracy.</p>
                </div> 

                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Mobile Robots</h3>
                    <p>In the 1970’s, researchers began exploring the concept of mobile robots. The earliest example of this is Shakey the Robot, developed by Stanford University. Shaky had the ability to reason its surroundings and perform tasks that required planning, path routing and arrangement of objects.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Autonomous robots</h3>
                    <p>Robots like Shakey and the advancements of sensor technology during the 1980’s allowed robots to gather information about their surroundings. This paved the way for the development of autonomous robotics capable of decision making without human intervention. Examples of autonomous robots are Mars rovers, surgical robots, and self-driving cars.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Collaborative robots</h3>
                    <p>These machines, also known as Cobots, are equipped, and designed to operate safely around humans. They are able to detect and respond to human presence, enabling more efficient human-robot collaboration. An example of collaborative robots is the UR5 (2005) robot designed to automate CNC machine tending released by Universal Robots.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="module-section">
                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have significantly impacted robotics, enabling robotics to learn from data and adapt to their environments. In addition, enabling these machines to learn and make intelligent decisions.</p>
