                <h3>Humanoid Robots</h3>
                <p>Humanoid robots are advanced robotic systems designed to resemble and mimic human capabilities, both in appearance and behavior. They are often equipped with sophisticated sensors, actuators, and artificial intelligence algorithms that enable them to interact with humans and perform complex tasks. The concept of humanoid robots dates back to ancient myths and legends, where human-like automatons were depicted. Humanoid robots play a crucial role in advancing scientific research and technological innovation. Their ability to closely mimic human movements and interactions allows researchers to study human locomotion, cognition, and social behavior. The research applications of humanoid robots gained momentum in the late 20th century. One of the most notable humanoid robots is Honda's ASIMO, introduced in 2000. ASIMO showcased remarkable mobility, balance, and dexterity; a multi-functional mobile assistant that could help people with poor mobility.</p>

                    <h3>Entertainment</h3>
                    <p>Humanoid robots have gained immense popularity in the entertainment industry, where their human-like appearance and interactive capabilities provide captivating experiences for audiences. Entertainment robots have a rich history, with early examples including Toyama's Gakutensoku in the 1920s and Walt Disney's animatronic characters in the 1960s. However, recent advancements in robotics have propelled entertainment robots to new heights. The first example of a humanoid robot for entertainment is Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s mechanical knight around the year 1495. This mechanical knight was a series of mechanisms that allowed the automaton to stand up, sit down, move its arms and neck by a system of pulleys and cables used for entertainment at parties thrown by his wealthy patron. Nonetheless, entertainment robots are designed to engage and entertain people through their expressive movements, gestures, and interactive features. They often incorporate artificial intelligence and voice recognition technologies to enhance their communication capabilities.</p>
