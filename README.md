# SeniorProjectTeam11

Overview:
The Project: A web-based platform designed to streamline and enhance the learning experience for undergraduate students interested and wanting to get into the fields of robotics. More specifically, we are refactoring a codebase and adding additional features to make it our own with updated libraries. Our project is a National Science Foundation Project.
